 A UDP hole punching server in python + Godot Client

The python server is based on https://github.com/stylesuxx/udp-hole-punching/
The Godot client is based on https://github.com/henriquelalves/Godot-Bomber-matchmaking-server

This simple implementation is still a work in progress. All help and contributions are welcome!
